      <p>We are vote survivors. Yes. We were able to “sustain” our life during last vote in West Bengal and just continuing. Not without worrying about some very “burning” issues, obviously increment in oil price is one among them. But still continuing life of weaklings as we are, keeping our breath “afloat”. We were supposed to cast vote for candidates of our choice in the elections. But in reality we saw that, there are no personal choice in the matter of selecting candidates. There are influence of different interests and in some cases probably clan level decision. And moreover the result, the selected candidates, in most of the cases are the result of rigging the balot box, spreading terror among voters by goons.</p>

<p>We are afraid by so much death. Unofficial count of death during last panchayat poll in West Bengal is more than 30. Leave 30, why even one. I was thinking about this. Why so many people are dead. Are all of them, so much inspired by their leader, that they just fought until they died. By hearing the comments made by the current leaders, ruling and opposition, the actions taken by them, I doubt that it’s at all possible to be this much inspired by these lying machines. If they were not inspired, then why? I think for some winning this “contest” is directly related to their job and earning. And for that reason the clash is this big and this much demanding. There may be other reasons. But this is in my opinion is the most propelling one.</p>

<p>For the last few days, oil price is increasing. Previously, government subsidy kept an buffer over the increment of the same in international market. Now, the government has passed a bill to not give the subsidy. So the oil price is increasing with the rise of the price in international market. As a result the price is really high.</p>

<p>Now an example of thought process of a rougue politician’s mind. In the last month, there was Assembly election in Karnataka. After the declaration of the election result only, the price of the oil is increasing per day. Now the oposition in Loksabha are alleging the ruling party that, to influence the common mindset, central has not increased the oil price until the end of the election. Once it’s done, it gave nod to the oil companies for the increment. I don’t know what actually happened. But it’s amazing that someone can think so narrow mindedly and so vindictive-ly. And also if central had done this intentionally. It’s so rougue. And so scrupulous. This should not happen. Ruling party should be nutral and be above all the idiosyncrasies like this. They have already got most of the seats in the assembly, though they could not make the board, but the trend was in their favor. Then why did they need such a low level manoeuvre. Don’t know.</p>

<p>After all of this, we are common people. And we have to survive, vote after vote. With the increase of oil price, increase of price daily needs. But we don’t want the untimely deaths of anyone. Really we don’t want to see anymore lose of valuable life.</p>
