      <p><em>Mere Pyaari Bindu</em>. The movie may not be that good in terms of editing, the arrangement of the storyline, but it was enough to bring some of the sweetest memories of my childhood back. I may not have some one like <em>Bindu Shankar Narayana</em> to love, adore, reminisce memory of. But there were some moments. And the people in those moments made them sweet. There were some aunties like <em>Booby Mashi</em>, whom we longed for to meet. At that time, it was hard to tell what was, we were longing for, but some unknown feeling engulfed us completely. And there were some girls also. Of same age or younger than us. Girls didn’t give much attention to juniors. There were some girls who loved to criticise our every movement. Whatever that be. Be it newly bought cycle. Or riding on the cycle. Or come out to the playground. May be it was too late. Or too early. Never on time. And by any means she criticised. A long time after watching movies, came to know, those were the first steps of love. Who knew. If I could know, probably didn’t have to be single until the marriage. There were also some studious girls. Always tottering about the class, teachers, text books. It seemed that they were practically in school for all the time. And of-course some girls with superior complexity. Like they know everything from tieing shoelace to how to ride a cycle. I especially felt a sense of danger around these girls. I was always afraid, whether they would start asking any difficult questions. And yes. I think it would be a little difficult to find a Bengali boy, who has not tried to write poems or something. Yes. Almost all of the Bengali boys try to write something in their teenage. And in this regard, I was a little bit famous. Got requests for short poems very often. Some of them were successful, some were not. But it took a little time for us to understand that modern smart girls don’t like emotional short-liners. They are like the show stopper for them. But with these, the memories have become all memorable. And even after a long time, I can clearly remember those new feelings, fear to be exposed and above all the lamest excuses to cover for a friend. Long live childhood.</p>
