      <p>Today something happened between my parents. Someone self invited to our home and my mom agreed to that. My mom knows very little about this person. Still she agreed to him and asked to come. But my father feared and opposed this and told her to do so. Ultimately my mom also agreed reluctantly and the guest is not coming.</p>

<p>Our ancestral root belongs to East Bengal. And by nature we are very much welcoming. We are not very rich. But one or two guests coming or staying in our home was not a very big deal. I had seen my grandfather actually liked this kind of unknown guests. He used to say that, these increases the connections among people from different regions, sects. But now a days frauds have increased to such a level, we are afraid of inviting someone unknown. Let alone let them stay in our home. The reality series like “Crime Patrol” and “Savdhan India” have made us more cautious, more suspicious. We can not believe any one by his or her face value. It’s very painful. And in the process of filtering out bad ones, probably we are losing some potential good friends.</p>

<p>This is a difficult time for our civilisation, society, families. No one believes no one. In the process of elimination, people are getting desparate to find someone to trust. Someone to believe. And this desparation some times put them in gruesome situations, when they become completely puzzled about what to do. Mother kills her own child to protect the identity of her lover. It’s said, a child to a mother is the most close one. It’s true upto certain limits in animals. Some mammals actually eat their child if they are hungry or if the cub interrupts their sexual engagements. But we are human. Expected with some moral and a sense that tells us, we are human. But these kind of crimes directly hurts the basic instinct of beliefs. An infant can believe whom, but it’s mother. Don’t know. This is seriously a difficult time in the face of humanity and civilisation. We need to come out of this. I don’t know how. But we have to.</p>
