      <p>Getting inspiration for writing is not that easy. Like yesterday I couldn’t write anything. And this <em>100-word-daily-100-days</em> has just been into even not one week. Today I was reading a post by <a href="https://writingcooperative.com/the-5-surprising-skills-you-acquire-from-writing-every-single-day-2183080b2fa3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Barry Devret</a>. There he discussed five benefits of writing every day. But I think benefits are not limited to five only. A lot more. The writer has forgotten to mention one very important one. Discipline. Yes. If we try to write something every day. We have to think over the eternal question, what I should write about. And if we can come up with something for every day, this will become a habit. Habit to become more attentive on our present. This has been discussed as a benefit in the post. Most of the time, we actually think about past or future. Only the happiest people think about the present. It’s true in the deepest sense. I’m advocating for becoming a sage or something, but at least we can be more present in we are doing <em>currently</em>. This is very important. The first effect would be our work will be much more complete, thoughtful and perhaps more appealing to the audience. In Bengal, there is kind of proverb that, <em>ink, pen, mind writes together</em>. Don’t take the sentence in its literal meaning. Think about it deeply. To write about something, we need obviously ink and pen (nowadays keyboard and word processor in PC), and the most important player is the <em>mind</em>. We need to be attentive, observative, careful about what we are writing. In a sense, we have to use our motor functionality as well as neurons. And together they make us more disciplined, observant of the <em>present</em>. Nowadays we can have an only short span of concentrations. Playing games reduces the span drastically.   If we can engage ourselves within ourselves at least for an hour to write a presentable piece, that would really benefit us not just in five ways, but we can say five folds. Let’s write daily.</p>
