      <p>Generally, I don’t read newsletters of hosting companies. But today it was an exception for Dreamhost monthly newsletter. I opened and saw the first section was about their fight against Department Of Justice in the United States. DOJ slapped a search warrant over them to get the visitor details, including their name, photo identity, if exists, email addresses, obviously the owner details of a website, hosted on Dreamhost platform. The site hosts writeups, protest bills, contents to agitate against current president of United States Of America. But visitor details. Really. What the heck!!!</p>

<p>There should be some limit. And being America a nation supporter of free speech, free expression, this is not at all acceptable. There are other means of law enforcement to subdue any agitation, violence in mass. But this is completely shameful. Being a civilized people there is no way to stop anyone from expressing their principles and ideas or even their grudge over one or many people. And if there are no critics, the ruling party can’t become a good ruling party. And demanding the visitor details is a completely shameless incident.</p>

<p>So, being so agitated, started to search for available means to protect privacy and anonymity of online lives. Seems that there is a huge market for VPN and Proxy(web and socks). Actually, I’m searching for quite a long time. I didn’t like VPN. As it completely wraps the communication of the workstation. This is bad and can raise suspicion. There should be some normal traffic. And the browsing history, emails, chat logs should be private. Unless the user is protesting against a behemoth or doing some heinous crime, I don’t think anonymity is required. But privacy is a must. In another sense actually, privacy comes holding the hand of anonymity. Let’s see.</p>

<p>Searching and reading the privacy and anonymity fanatic websites and posts, came to know that, Finland and Iceland are the freest internet countries. There are almost no internet censorship in those places. It’s hard to get cheap hosting in Iceland. In Finland, there are a lot of hosting providers. But most of their packages are little expensive. Among them, I found <a href="https://creanova.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Creanova</a>. Their prices are affordable. Minimum VPS package is coming for only Euro 22. But they charge Paypal transaction fees. So, it’s actually Euro 24.06 to be exact. Probably their VPS delivery system is not automated. So, I’ve not still received my VPS.</p>

<p>I plan to host a SOCKS proxy on the VPS and connect Firefox. So, expected that all the web connections made by Firefox will pass through the SOCKS tunnel. Assuming that the encryption and authentication security is strong enough, that no one can intercept the actual request or TCP/UDP packets until the request goes out of the SOCKS proxy. And every website, I’m visiting will log the IP of the VPS. And I’m mapped to the VPS, so if anyone traces a request, I will be exposed. And the privacy I’m looking for is exposed. Anyone with proper means can track my browsing history, emails, chat logs everything, by simply tapping the gateway of the VPS. So, anonymity is also required.</p>

<p>To make browsing full anonymous, we need to make use of TOR network. It’s by far most efficient anonymizer available. Now, if my SOCKS server can work through a tor, then everything is achieved. Local ISP’s will not be able to trace HTTP requests. So, local censorships won’t work. And Finland being among the most internet censorship free countries in the world, I’ll be able to breathe in free air, while all my requests will be anonymous.</p>

<p>I don’t interact much electronically outside of my work, so email or chat anonymity is not required that much for now. But for them, there are solutions like <a href="https://www.whonix.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Whonix</a>, <a href="https://tails.boum.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tails</a>, <a href="https://riseup.net/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Riseup</a> (but getting an invite for Riseup Red, may be a little tricky). And hopefully, more will come. It’s absurd that, someone will be able to actually take our freedom to roam freely on the internet. There will always be some means to circumvent all the rules and censorships. But, as netizens, we should also maintain our civilized mind in our day-to-day activities.</p>
