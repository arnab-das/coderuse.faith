      <p>After all, we are alone. Some are by choice. Some are by the situation. And few, very few feel they are not alone. Though by nature and basic instinct of human beings, we are alone. Alone by our own side. More we go, more we travel we become alone. So the first lesson of being a sage is being alone. Buddhists say monks should be alone like a rhinoceros. Because they have to travel a lot. So less the baggage better they can travel. Be in the company, but don’t bear the bags for the company. Love, care, sympathy should be for everyone equally. There would be no expectations as there would be no one special. And most of the fear, most of the conflicts would go away. Long long miles apart. And of course, we have to pack our backpacks light. Otherwise, we would become selfish. If we are not willing to carry any one’s bag, we should not also make a bag of our own. But we have to continue our journey. So we need some essentials. But we have to choose them very carefully. Not a single item except the real necessities. At the first time, everyone gets confused regarding what to choose and what not to. So we need guidance. We need teachers. We have to be very careful in choosing the teacher. The teachers are those who have already traveled some distance and know the perils of the route so that they can warn us. But we have to see whether the goal of the route taken by the teacher have some similarity to the goal we want to see for ourselves. Meeting a good teacher is very difficult. And a lot of potentials actually gets wasted due to the teachers and also a lot bloom to the perfection for them. The Same road may not be suitable for everyone. And it has always been observed that being in the vicinity of the most crowded road is the safest. After all the destination is same for all. Only the differences are on the routes we take to reach the destination. If we can believe on a route, that will take to the destination. Some delay may occur. Determination is the only key to reach. And as a matter of speak, there is no end in the travel. Beware of those, who say they have reached. No one can stop the journey as there are always new things to learn, new places to go, new ideas to try. Saturation, satisfaction is the death of a traveler. Enjoy the joy of making the journey. No matter what we have to continue. Continuity is life.</p>
